  name: "Koushik",
  lifeStory: "I wasn't built through a traditional academic path — I was built through curiosity. I grew up obsessed with games, systems, and understanding how things work. Over time, that obsession turned into a deep passion for AI and engineering. Everything I've learned came from self-study, late nights, experiments, and failures that pushed me forward. My entire journey is proof that consistency and curiosity can shape someone more than any classroom.",
  superpower: "My superpower is relentless focus. If there's something I don't understand, I sit with it until I do — whether it takes an hour, a day, or five days. I don't quit. I break the problem apart, explore every angle, fail, retry, and keep pushing until it finally clicks. Combined with my fast pattern recognition and emotional control, this makes me unstoppable when I'm learning or solving something new.",
  growthAreas: [
    "Deep Systems & Research-Level Engineering — building complex AI systems end-to-end with the reliability and depth of top labs",
    "Leadership & Communication — becoming better at explaining complex ideas simply and leading teams with clarity",
    "Mathematics & Theory — strengthening my foundations to push closer toward cutting-edge AI research work"
  ],
  misconception: "People often think I'm 'too serious' or always in work mode. The truth is: I'm just highly focused and disciplined. Once someone actually talks to me, they realize I'm creative, friendly, and curious — I just tend to show my intensity first.",
  pushingBoundaries: "I push my boundaries by choosing problems that intimidate me. If something feels too big or too advanced, I move toward it, not away from it. I learn aggressively, experiment constantly, and keep going even when it's uncomfortable. I break complex things into simple steps until they're no longer scary. Growth for me happens at the edge of difficulty — and I deliberately stay there."
